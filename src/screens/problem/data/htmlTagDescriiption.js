      <p>
        A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, connected, undirected graph
        is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.
        The spanning tree includes all the vertices of the graph, and the total
        weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm are both popular algorithms
        used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted undirected
        graph, but they use different approaches to achieve this.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In summary, both algorithms are effective for finding minimum spanning
        trees, but the choice between them often depends on factors such as the
        graph representation, graph density, and available data structures.
